    "# Buy Signal  - group1:\n",

    "## Problem and Goal Statement:\n",
    "   The recent rise of retail investors and day traders, as seen in news stories pertaining to GameStop and AMC, coupled with the increase in internet usage for research, and general information sharing purposes over the last 20 years poses an interesting question as to how stock price and search engine hits (such as Google searches) are tied together. More specifically our team analyzed how a desired company’s closing stock price can be affected by “Google Trends” search interest data to see if there is a strong enough correlation to build a model that would accurately predict a price increase for a given day and therefore could generate a “buy signal” for traders.\n",
    "\t\n",
    "   Factors of importance needed to develop an acceptable model will include: previous day’s share price, volume of shares trade, and Google Trends search history score, which is a number between 0-100 that is base lined  off of the highest search interest day in a given time period. Data can be pulled direct from most finance sites and the Google Trend website. We then added a few manually calculated relationship fields, such as whether or not the price or trend increases the previous day to enhance our models. Our model will be built and trained primarily on data from Q2 in calendar year 2021 (April – June) and will be tested on July 2021 data. The models performance will be easily analyzed by comparing the predicted values to the actual values. \n"
